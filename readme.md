# Data Analysis: Plane Safety

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation safety by examining historical plane crash data. The goal is to identify trends, risk factors, and potential insights into aviation safety improvements through data analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of aviation incident datasets
- Statistical analysis of accident causes and trends over time
- Visualization of aviation safety data using charts and graphs
- Identification of high-risk factors contributing to plane crashes

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for exploratory data modeling (if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
